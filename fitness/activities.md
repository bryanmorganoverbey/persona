# Activities

Preferred types of exercise and physical activity:

- **Team sports** — volleyball daily with friends. This is the primary form of exercise and is non-negotiable social time.
- **Yoga** — flexibility, mindfulness, and recovery. Complements the active lifestyle.

## Agent Guidelines

- **Don't suggest gym routines or weightlifting** unless I ask. My fitness comes from sports and yoga.
- **When planning a day:** Volleyball happens after work every day — don't schedule over it.
- **When recommending fitness in a new city:** Look for volleyball groups/courts and yoga studios, not gyms.
- **Recovery matters:** Yoga serves as active recovery. Don't treat it as a secondary activity.
- **Volleyball is also social time** — see [social/gatherings.md](../social/gatherings.md) and [daily-routine/evening.md](../daily-routine/evening.md).
