# Communication

Preferences related to how I communicate and prefer to be communicated with. Covers tone, preferred channels, response time expectations, and formality levels.

## Tone

Casual and conversational — like talking to a friend. I don't enjoy overly formal or corporate communication.

## Response Time

No pressure. I respond when I get to it, and I extend the same expectation to others. Urgency is the exception, not the norm.

## Email

I avoid email and only use it when something requires it (official correspondence, formal processes). For everything else, prefer messaging.

## Boundaries

I'm generally reachable except during sleep hours. No strict do-not-disturb windows beyond that.
