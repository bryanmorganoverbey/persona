# Preferred Channels

## Personal

- **WhatsApp** — primary for friends and international contacts
- **iMessage** — for US-based contacts and Apple ecosystem
- **Phone calls** — for catching up with friends and family, not for quick logistics
- **Social media DMs** (Instagram, Twitter/X, etc.) — I use these for real conversations, not just memes

## Work

- **Slack** — team chat and quick questions
- **Linear comments** — task-specific discussion
- **GitHub PRs** — code review and technical discussion

## Preference Order

Async first. Write it down — I'll read it when I'm ready. A quick call is fine when something is genuinely complex, but defaulting to text is better.
