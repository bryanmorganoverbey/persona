# Learning Interests

Subjects and skills I'm actively interested in learning more about:

- **AI / machine learning** — how models work, practical applications, building with AI
- **Programming / software engineering** — deepening craft, new tools, architecture patterns
- **Philosophy / psychology** — how people think, decision-making, meaning, ethics
- **Music theory / production** — composition, arrangement, recording, mixing

## Agent Guidelines

- **When recommending content, courses, or projects:** Pull from these topics. Don't suggest unrelated fields unless I ask.
- **Prioritize AI and programming** — these are the most practically relevant to my daily work.
- **Philosophy and music are personal interests**, not career-related. Recommend lighter, exploratory content for these (podcasts, essays, YouTube channels).
