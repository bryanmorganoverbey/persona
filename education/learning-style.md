# Learning Style

Preferred ways to learn new things:

1. **Hands-on projects / building** — I learn by doing. Building real things is always better than passive study.
2. **AI-assisted learning** — using ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI tools to explore topics, get explanations, and iterate on understanding.

## Agent Guidelines

- **When recommending learning resources:** Prefer project-based tutorials, interactive courses, or "build X from scratch" formats. Avoid lecture-heavy or textbook-style content.
- **When teaching me something:** Show me how to build it, not just how it works in theory.
- **Don't suggest:** MOOCs with long video lectures, certification programs focused on exams, or passive reading lists.
- **AI is a learning tool** — I'd rather have a conversation with an AI about a topic than watch a 2-hour course.
- See [technology/tools.md](../technology/tools.md) for the specific AI tools I use daily.
