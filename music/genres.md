# Genres

Preferred music genres:

1. Hip-hop / Rap
2. Rock / Alternative
3. Lo-fi / Chillhop
4. Electronic / House / Techno

## Agent Guidelines

- **When creating playlists or recommending music:** Pull from these genres. Lo-fi / chillhop is ideal for work focus; hip-hop and electronic for energy.
- **Music plays constantly** as background throughout the day (see [listening-context.md](./listening-context.md)).
- **Avoid:** Country, pop ballads, classical (unless ambient/instrumental for focus).
- **Spotify is the platform** — see [entertainment/streaming.md](../entertainment/streaming.md).
