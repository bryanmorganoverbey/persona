# Preferences

This repository is a directory of files which label and specify all of the preferences that I have for all kinds of things in life. It is used to direct AI agents for how exactly they should complete tasks on my behalf.

The purpose is to give AI agents all kinds of context on all kinds of different things so that they know how to handle tasks for me.

## How to use this repository

Each top-level folder represents a category of preferences. Within each folder, markdown files describe specific preferences, requirements, and constraints for that category. AI agents should consult the relevant files before making decisions or completing tasks that fall under a given category. Every folder contains an `index.md` with a summary of the category and a listing of its files.
