# Emergency Plan

## Current Approach

Honestly — I'd figure it out in the moment. I don't have a formal emergency plan for situations abroad.

## What I Do Have

- US health insurance (limited coverage abroad)
- Digital copies of all important documents (see [documents.md](./documents.md))
- Family in Tennessee who could help coordinate from the US side
- Partner who travels with me

## Known Gaps

- No international health / evacuation insurance
- No pre-identified hospitals or clinics in current location
- No formal plan for natural disasters, political instability, etc.

## Agent Guidelines

- **This is an area for improvement.** If I'm planning a move to a new country, proactively suggest looking into:
  - Local hospital / clinic options
  - International health insurance
  - US embassy location and contact info
  - Local emergency numbers
- **Don't be alarmist**, but do flag practical gaps when relevant. I'm not reckless — I just haven't formalized this yet.
- **When moving to a new place:** Include basic emergency info (nearest hospital, emergency numbers, embassy) in the move-in research.
