# Insurance

## Current Coverage

- **US health insurance** — active

## Gaps

- No international / travel health insurance (should consider this given the nomad lifestyle)
- No renters insurance (renting abroad, usually short-term)
- No life insurance

## Agent Guidelines

- **If I ask about insurance:** Be aware that I currently only have US health insurance. For international coverage, I'd need to research travel health / expat insurance options.
- **When planning extended stays abroad:** Flag that I don't have international health coverage. This is a known gap.
- **When I buy the house in Tennessee:** Homeowners insurance will become relevant — add it to the list.
