# Important Documents

## Storage

Important documents are stored digitally in **organized cloud storage** — accessible from any device, anywhere.

This includes copies of:
- Passport
- Insurance cards
- IDs
- Financial documents
- Travel documents

## Agent Guidelines

- **Assume I can access important documents remotely.** I don't need to be home or have physical copies on hand.
- **When helping with travel, housing, or financial tasks:** I can pull up relevant documents quickly — don't treat document access as a blocker.
