# Family

My family is in Tennessee. I stay close with my parents and siblings.

## Contact Cadence

- **Frequency:** A few times a week — texts, calls, updates
- **Visits:** Varies depending on where I'm living. More frequent when I'm in the US, less when abroad.
- **2026 plan:** Moving back to Tennessee mid-year, so proximity will increase significantly

## Agent Guidelines

- **When planning travel or moves:** Factor in family proximity. Tennessee is home base.
- **When scheduling calls or meetings:** Family calls are casual and don't need to be scheduled — they happen naturally.
- **Don't over-formalize family communication.** I don't need reminders to call my mom — it happens organically.
- **Gift occasions:** Know that family birthdays, holidays, and visits are gift-giving moments (see [gifts/preferences.md](../gifts/preferences.md)).
