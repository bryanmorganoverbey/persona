# Professional Networking

Networking happens naturally through work and social life. I don't go to networking events or intentionally "work the room."

## How It Happens

- Through work — colleagues, open source, code review
- Through social life — friends of friends, co-living communities, shared activities
- Through online presence — GitHub, social media, tech communities

## Agent Guidelines

- **Don't suggest networking events, meetups, or conferences** for the purpose of networking. If I attend events, it's for the content or social aspect, not to collect contacts.
- **Don't suggest LinkedIn outreach or cold messaging.** Professional connections happen organically.
- **Building a tech reputation is a goal** (see [personal-brand/](../personal-brand/)), but through creating things, not through networking.
