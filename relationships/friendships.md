# Friendships

## Style

I build a crew wherever I'm living. Proximity matters — my closest friends are the people I see regularly in the current place. When I move, I build a new local circle.

## Long-Distance Friendships

Occasional check-ins with friends from previous places. We pick up where we left off when we reconnect. I don't actively maintain a large long-distance network — a few close ones stay in touch, the rest fade naturally and that's okay.

## What I Value in Friendships

- Regular, activity-based hangouts (volleyball, meals, games)
- Low-maintenance communication — no pressure to respond quickly
- People who are doing interesting things with their lives
- Showing up consistently, not grand gestures

## Agent Guidelines

- **When suggesting social activities:** Default to group activities with existing friends, not networking events or meetups with strangers.
- **When I move to a new place:** Help me find community — volleyball groups, co-living spaces, social sports leagues, coworking spaces with events.
- **Don't suggest maintaining friendships through scheduled calls or elaborate systems.** I keep it natural.
- See [social/gatherings.md](../social/gatherings.md) for group size preferences.
