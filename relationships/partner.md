# Partner

I have a girlfriend. We live and travel together.

## Agent Guidelines

- **When planning travel, housing, or moves:** Always account for two people (plus Remi the dog). Accommodation, flights, and activities should assume we're together.
- **When suggesting date ideas or activities:** Align with shared interests — cooking, travel, outdoor activities, trying new restaurants.
- **Housing:** All housing criteria apply for both of us living together.
