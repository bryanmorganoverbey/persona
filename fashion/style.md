# Style

Day-to-day clothing style: **athleisure** — comfortable, athletic-inspired clothing suitable for both casual outings and light activity.

## Agent Guidelines

- **When shopping for clothes or recommending outfits:** Default to athleisure. Think joggers, performance tees, lightweight sneakers, hoodies.
- **Avoid:** Formal wear, dress shoes, button-downs, and anything that requires dry cleaning — unless I specifically ask for an occasion.
- **Climate context:** I live in warm, walkable places (see [travel/destinations.md](../travel/destinations.md)), so prioritize breathable, lightweight fabrics.
- **Brands:** No strong brand loyalty. Prioritize comfort and fit over labels.
- **Secondhand is fine** — see [shopping/habits.md](../shopping/habits.md).
