# Work

Preferences related to productivity and work environment. Covers scheduling, tooling, workspace setup, meeting preferences, and workflow habits.

## Role

Software engineer, fully remote. Location independence is a hard requirement — I travel and live in different places, so remote work is non-negotiable.

## Workspace

Nomadic setup — no permanent home office. I work from wherever I'm living at the time (apartments, co-living spaces, Airbnbs). My workspace is my laptop and whatever table is available.

## Schedule

Standard 9am–5pm. I protect these boundaries and don't work outside them.

## Focus Style

Pomodoro-style: 25 minutes of focused work, 15-minute breaks. I don't use a timer — I go by feel and switch when I naturally need a reset.

## Task Management

- **Linear** for work task tracking
- **Apple Notes** for quick notes and personal tasks
- I pick what to work on based on what interests me most at the moment, not strict priority ordering.

## Meetings

Minimal meetings, high collaboration. I value coding together, sharing tools and methodologies, and exchanging knowledge — but not sitting in scheduled calls for the sake of it. Lean async: write it down and I'll read it, but a quick call is fine when something is genuinely complex.

## Work Communication

- **Slack** for team chat
- **Linear comments** for task discussion
- **GitHub PRs** for code review and technical discussion

## Workflow

Cursor is the primary orchestrator for AI agents. AI is core to my development workflow — I use it for most coding, writing, and thinking.
