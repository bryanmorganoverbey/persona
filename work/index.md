# Work

Preferences related to productivity and work environment. Covers scheduling, tooling, workspace setup, meeting preferences, and workflow habits.

## environment

I prefer remote work. I like being able to travel, so remote work is a necessity for me.

## meeting preferences

I prefer having minimal meetings, but still communicating important information to one another and having high collaboration. Things like coding together, sharing stories, sharing tools and methodologies are great.

## workflow

Right now I am using Cursor as the orchestrator for AI agents.
