# Schedule

## Working Hours

**9am–5pm**, strict boundaries. I don't work outside these hours.

## Focus Structure

Pomodoro-style: **25 minutes on, 15 minutes off**. No timer — I go by feel and take breaks when I naturally need them.

## Task Selection

I work on whatever interests me most at the moment. I don't follow a rigid daily plan or strict priority queue.
