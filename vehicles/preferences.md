# Vehicle Preferences

## Current Vehicles

- **2016 Red Chevy Tahoe** — 4x4, primary vehicle when in the US
- **Honda CRF 250L** — enduro/dual-sport motorcycle

## Preferences

- **SUV / crossover** — preferred vehicle type when driving.
- **Motorcycle / scooter** — also of interest, especially in walkable cities abroad.
- **Public transit** — preferred over driving when available. I don't necessarily need a car.

## Agent Guidelines

- **When evaluating a city or destination:** Walkability and public transit matter more than driving infrastructure. I'd rather not need a vehicle.
- **When I'm in the US:** I have the Tahoe. Don't suggest rental cars.
- **When abroad:** I usually don't have a vehicle. Prioritize walkable areas, scooter rentals, or transit-friendly locations.
- **Don't suggest car purchases** unless I ask. My current setup works.
- See [travel/destinations.md](../travel/destinations.md) — walkability is a core destination criterion.
