# Core Values

## Top 3

These are the values that carry the most weight in decisions:

1. **Freedom / independence** — Location independence specifically. Being able to live and work from anywhere is the foundation everything else is built on. This is a dealbreaker: if a job, city, or relationship takes away this freedom, I'm out.
2. **Community / connection** — Regular group activities and shared experiences with friends. Volleyball every day after work is the current expression of this. It's about showing up consistently with the same people, not maintaining a huge network.
3. **Health / well-being** — Physical and mental health as a baseline, not a luxury. Daily movement, good food, proper sleep.

## Full List

All values, including the top 3:

- Freedom / independence
- Personal growth / self-improvement
- Creativity / self-expression
- Community / connection
- Adventure / exploration
- Health / well-being
- Family
- Making an impact / purpose
- Knowledge / learning
- Financial independence

## When Values Conflict

I go with my gut. I don't have a rigid hierarchy — I weigh the specifics of the situation and trust my instinct.

## Dealbreaker

Freedom / independence. If something restricts my ability to live and work from wherever I choose, it's a non-starter regardless of what else it offers.
