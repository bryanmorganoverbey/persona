# Sustainability Philosophy

Price and quality come first. Sustainability is a welcome bonus but not the primary driver of purchasing decisions.

## Agent Guidelines

- **Don't filter options by sustainability first.** Show the best value, then note if a sustainable option is comparable.
- **Secondhand / thrift shopping is preferred** when practical (see [shopping/habits.md](../shopping/habits.md)) — this aligns with sustainability naturally, but the motivation is value, not environmentalism.
- **Don't guilt-frame recommendations.** I care about sustainability but don't make decisions based on carbon footprint alone.
