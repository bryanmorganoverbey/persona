## Agent Guidelines

- **Default to English** for all written communication and content.
- **Spanish is usable** for daily life, especially relevant since I'm currently in Mexico. Don't avoid Spanish-language resources or options.
- **When recommending destinations:** Spanish-speaking countries are a natural fit for comfortable immersion.
- See [travel/regions.md](../travel/regions.md) — Central and South America are top travel regions, where Spanish is essential.
