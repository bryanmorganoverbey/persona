# Style

Interior decoration style: a mix of **bohemian** and **Japanese**.

- **Bohemian:** Indoor plants (monstera, other tropical houseplants), textured textiles, warm and lived-in feel.
- **Japanese:** Minimalism, intentional use of space, clean lines, natural materials.

## Color Palette

- Earth tones (brown, terracotta, olive, sand)
- Natural wood and green (plants)

## Agent Guidelines

- **When recommending furniture or decor:** Prioritize natural materials (wood, linen, ceramic, rattan). Avoid plastic, chrome, or ultra-modern industrial aesthetics.
- **Less is more.** Don't suggest filling a space — suggest pieces that serve a purpose or add warmth.
- **Plants are always welcome.** When in doubt, suggest a plant.
- **Keep it portable.** I move frequently (see [travel/trip-duration.md](../travel/trip-duration.md)), so don't recommend heavy, permanent, or expensive furniture. Think items that make a rented space feel like home without being hard to leave behind.
