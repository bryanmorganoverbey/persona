# Style

My favorite interior decoration style is a mix of bohemian and Japanese.

I like the bohemian plants like monstera plants and other house plants indoors.

I like the minimalism and use of space from Japanese interior decoration.

## Color Palette

- Earth tones (brown, terracotta, olive, sand)
- Natural wood and green (plants)
