# Productivity Tools

## Personal

- **Apple Calendar** — scheduling, events, reminders
- **Apple Notes** — quick capture, to-do lists, personal notes
- **AI agents (Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT)** — delegation and automation for tasks I don't want to do manually

## Work

- **Linear** — task tracking and project management
- **GitHub** — code and collaboration
- **Cursor** — AI-powered development

## Agent Guidelines

- **Don't suggest new productivity tools** unless they solve a specific problem I've expressed. I'm happy with Apple Calendar + Apple Notes.
- **When I need to remember something:** Put it on the calendar or in Apple Notes. Don't suggest a new app.
- See [technology/tools.md](../technology/tools.md) for the full tools list.
