# Productivity Philosophy

## Core Principle

**Protect free time.** The goal of productivity is not to fill every hour — it's to get things done efficiently so there's more time for living. I don't over-schedule, and I resist rigid personal systems.

## How I Plan

- **Apple Calendar** for scheduling — I put things on the calendar when they matter
- **Work is structured** (9-5, Pomodoro) but personal time is intentionally unstructured
- **I don't plan every weekend or evening** — I leave room for spontaneity

## How I Handle Tasks I Don't Want to Do

Delegate or automate when possible. If something can be handed off to an AI agent, another person, or a service — do that before grinding through it manually.

## What I Don't Do

- Elaborate productivity systems (no bullet journals, no Notion dashboards for life)
- Time-blocking personal hours
- Setting alarms or reminders for everything
- Optimizing for "output" outside of work hours

## Agent Guidelines

- **Don't build complex productivity systems for me.** Keep it simple — calendar events and notes are enough.
- **When suggesting how to handle a task:** Always consider whether it can be delegated or automated first. Manual effort is the last resort.
- **Don't overschedule my personal time.** If I ask for help planning a weekend, leave gaps. Unstructured time is intentional, not wasted.
- **Work productivity is covered in** [work/](../work/) — Pomodoro, Linear, interest-driven task selection.
