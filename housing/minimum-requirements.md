# Minimum Requirements (Shared Baseline)

These apply to any property regardless of country. See [us-requirements.md](./us-requirements.md) and [mexico-requirements.md](./mexico-requirements.md) for country-specific overrides.

## household

Planning for a couple full-time. Storage, bathroom supplies, and bedroom setup should accommodate two people.

## size

The minimum square footage for a property I would reside in is 700 sqft (approximately 65 m²).

## housing type

Prefer houses in both the US and Mexico. Apartments and condos are acceptable only if all other requirements are met.

## no bugs

No palapa roofs. No open design. The walls, roof, floor, and windows all need to be sealed so that no bugs can enter.

Check pillows, blankets, and mattresses to be sure there are no bed bugs.

## yard and outdoor space

I would only consider a house if it has a fenced-in yard and patio. Garden or planting space is also desired.

## location

Proximity to work, transit, groceries, healthcare, and other daily essentials. Maximum acceptable commute time should be short. Many social activities, sports, events, and coffee shops should be within a close five-minute walk.

### seasonal split

- Mid-April through November 1: United States
- November 1 through mid-April: Mexico

## safety

The area needs to be in a low-crime area, out of the way of natural disasters (flood, fire, earthquake). The property and surrounding area should feel safe at all hours. Street lighting and neighborhood stability matter.

## storage

There needs to be plenty of room for storing clothes in a closet for at least two people.

## climate control

Any form of air conditioning is required (window unit, mini-split, central -- any will do).

## natural light

Window count, orientation preferences (e.g., south-facing), and minimum number of rooms with exterior windows. Rooms should not feel dark or cave-like during the day.

## noise

Moderate noise tolerance -- some city noise is fine, but not directly on a main road. No highways, airports, or railways nearby.

## age and condition

Maximum acceptable building age, required renovation state, and structural standards for foundation, roof, plumbing, and electrical systems.

## internet connectivity

Minimum acceptable internet speed is 100 Mbps -- comfortable for remote work with video calls and multiple devices.

## HOA

No HOAs. No HOA fees or regulations. I regularly do things like park cars and have people over and loud noises and machinery that would not comply with an HOA.

## kitchen

Kitchen needs to come with a full-size refrigerator, full-size sink, and a full-size stove with at least two burners. The kitchen needs to be equipped with pots, pans, ladles, spoons, forks, knives, and all the cutlery and everything to cook a full three-course meal.

The kitchen also needs to include a blender, an oven, a coffee pot, and an ice cube maker for the freezer.

## bathrooms

At least one full bathroom is the minimum requirement. The bare minimum number of towels is three per person.

## bedrooms

For a rental property, the minimum number of bedrooms is one bedroom and that one bedroom needs to be separated from the kitchen and living room areas.

## workspace

Two dedicated desk/office areas required for remote work. These can be in a dedicated room or clearly defined work zones -- not just a dining table.

## budget

- USA: maximum $2,000/month
- Outside the US or Europe: maximum $1,600/month

No strong preference on whether utilities are included in rent or billed separately.

## lease duration

6-month leases preferred for rental properties.

## appliances

There needs to be a washing machine and a way to dry clothes on the property.

## feng shui

Houses must include feng shui concepts. Specifically:
- The front entrance should not directly align with the back door or a staircase (prevents qi from rushing through).
- The kitchen should not face or be directly visible from the front door.
- The primary bedroom should support a commanding position -- the bed can be placed so the door is visible without being directly in line with it.
- Adequate natural light and cross-ventilation throughout the home to support healthy qi flow.
- Bathrooms should not be located at the center of the home or directly above the front entrance.
- The home should allow for a clear, unobstructed entryway (no cramped or cluttered foyer).

## water quality

Drinkable water access required. If tap water is not potable, the property should have a filtration system or a reliable garrafón (jug) delivery arrangement.

## guest accommodation

Space to host at least one guest comfortably -- a spare bedroom, convertible sofa, or dedicated guest area.

## smart home features

Open to smart home features: smart locks, smart thermostat, smart lighting. Not required, but a plus.

## pool / hot tub

Not required but considered a bonus, especially in warm climates.

## floor level preference

For apartments: prefer lower floors (ground or second floor) for ease of access and move-in/move-out convenience. Upper floors acceptable if there is an elevator.

## views

Natural views (greenery, mountains, courtyard) preferred over parking lots, walls, or busy streets.

## roommate policies

No roommates. The property is for the couple only, plus occasional guests.

## sub-letting

Ability to sub-let or list on Airbnb when traveling is a plus but not a requirement.
