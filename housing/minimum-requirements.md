## size

The minimum square footage for a property I would reside in is 700sqft (approximately 65m²).

## feng shui

Houses must include feng shui concepts. Specifically:
- The front entrance should not directly align with the back door or a staircase (prevents qi from rushing through).
- The kitchen should not face or be directly visible from the front door.
- The primary bedroom should support a commanding position — the bed can be placed so the door is visible without being directly in line with it.
- Adequate natural light and cross-ventilation throughout the home to support healthy qi flow.
- Bathrooms should not be located at the center of the home or directly above the front entrance.
- The home should allow for a clear, unobstructed entryway (no cramped or cluttered foyer).
