# Mexico Housing Requirements

Overrides and additions to [minimum-requirements.md](./minimum-requirements.md) that apply specifically to Mexico properties.

## ownership

Renting only. No plans to purchase property in Mexico.

## target regions

Oaxaca (city and surrounding areas).

## seasonal occupancy

November 1 through mid-April.

## neighborhood vibe

Walkable urban. Restaurants, shops, cafés, markets, and cultural activities within walking distance.

## parking

No parking space needed.

## furnishing

Furnished required. The rental should come move-in ready with furniture, kitchenware, linens, and towels.

## laundry

Washing machine required. Clothesline or drying rack for drying is acceptable (no dryer needed).

## budget

Maximum $1,600/month rent. Preference for utilities included but not a deal-breaker.

## water quality

Tap water in Mexico is generally not potable. Property must have a filtration system or established garrafón delivery. A water filter on the kitchen tap is a strong plus.

## internet connectivity

100 Mbps minimum still applies. Verify actual speeds at the address -- advertised speeds in Mexico can vary significantly from reality. Telmex fiber (Infinitum) or Totalplay coverage preferred.

## safety

Verify neighborhood safety through local knowledge, not just statistics. Avoid areas known for cartel activity or frequent theft. Well-lit streets and active foot traffic at night are important.

## lease duration

6-month leases preferred, aligning with the seasonal stay. Flexibility to extend or shorten by a month is a plus.
