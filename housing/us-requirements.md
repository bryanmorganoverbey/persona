# US Housing Requirements

Overrides and additions to [minimum-requirements.md](./minimum-requirements.md) that apply specifically to US properties.

## ownership

Plan to own property in the US.

## target regions

South / Southeast United States. Current target states:
- Tennessee
- Florida

## seasonal occupancy

Mid-April through November 1.

## neighborhood vibe

Quiet residential. Low traffic, family-oriented streets, space between neighbors.

## parking

Parking space for at least two cars required (garage, driveway, or dedicated spots).

## furnishing

Unfurnished preferred. Will furnish with own furniture.

## laundry

In-unit washer and dryer required.

## budget

Maximum $2,000/month for mortgage or rent (excluding property taxes and insurance if purchasing).

## pet-friendliness

No HOA or landlord restrictions on pets. Yard should be suitable for pets. Proximity to parks or veterinary clinics is a plus.

## accessibility

Single-story preference. Step-free entry and wide doorways are a plus for long-term livability.

## preferences but not required

We prefer a kitchen to have a bar-top style counter space for sitting at bar stools and working or hanging out.
