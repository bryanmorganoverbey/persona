# Investment Interests

Types of investments I'm interested in, in order of current engagement:

1. **Index funds / ETFs** — core long-term holdings.
2. **Real estate** — rental properties, land, or REITs.
3. **Own business ventures** — building and investing in my own projects.
4. **Cryptocurrency** — speculative allocation, not a core strategy.

## Agent Guidelines

- **When suggesting investments:** Default to index funds / ETFs for general advice. Only suggest individual stocks or crypto if I bring it up.
- **Real estate:** I'm interested but mobile — suggest options that don't require physical presence (REITs, property management, remote-friendly markets).
- **Don't recommend:** Annuities, whole life insurance, bonds, or any low-growth preservation instruments unless I ask.
- **Tax optimization matters** — consider tax-advantaged accounts and strategies when relevant.
- **Real estate context:** I'm actively looking to buy a house in Mt. Juliet, TN in 2026. See [housing/](../housing/) and [vision_boards/2026/](../vision_boards/2026/).
