# Financial Philosophy

Approach to saving and investing: **aggressive growth**. I prioritize maximizing investments and long-term wealth building over conservative preservation.

## Agent Guidelines

- **When presenting financial options:** Lean toward higher-growth, higher-risk options. Don't default to conservative.
- **Spending:** I'm not frugal for the sake of it, but I don't waste money. Value-conscious, not cheap.
- **Financial independence is a core value** — any financial advice should move toward reducing dependence on a paycheck (see [values/core.md](../values/core.md)).
- **Don't suggest savings accounts or low-yield instruments** unless I specifically ask about safe parking of cash.
