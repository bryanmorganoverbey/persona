# Profile

A high-level summary for AI agents to read before consulting any specific category. This is the "who am I" file — use it to orient yourself before diving into details.

## At a Glance

- **Age:** Early 30s
- **Current location:** Mexico
- **Lifestyle:** Digital nomad — I move between warm, walkable places
- **Work:** Remote software engineer, fully location-independent
- **Family:** Loving family in Tennessee, a partner, and a dog named Remi
- **Top values:** Freedom, community, health

## Who I Am

I'm a driven, ambitious person who is always building something. I prioritize location independence above almost everything else — the ability to live and work from anywhere is the foundation my life is built on. I gravitate toward warm, walkable cities where I can have a daily routine centered around work, movement, and community.

Community for me means regular group activities with the same people — not a huge network, but consistent presence. Right now that looks like daily volleyball with friends after work.

I take health seriously as a baseline, not a side project. Daily movement, proper food, good sleep.

## How I Work

- Remote only, 9–5 with strict boundaries
- Pomodoro-style focus (25 on / 15 off, by feel)
- AI is core to my workflow — Cursor as the orchestrator, Claude and ChatGPT as daily tools
- TypeScript, Python, Terraform on AWS
- Task tracking in Linear, notes in Apple Notes
- I pick work based on interest, not rigid prioritization

## How I Communicate

- Casual and conversational tone — like talking to a friend
- Lean async: write it down, I'll read it when I'm ready
- No urgency culture — I respond when I get to it
- I avoid email; prefer WhatsApp, iMessage, Slack, or social media DMs
- Phone calls are for catching up with people, not logistics

## Default Guidance for Agents

When there's no explicit preference file for a decision, **ask me**. Don't guess or optimize on my behalf without checking — I'd rather be consulted than surprised.
