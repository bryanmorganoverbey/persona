# Hosting

I prefer **not to host** events. I'm more comfortable attending gatherings than organizing them.

## Agent Guidelines

- **Don't suggest hosting dinner parties or events at my place** unless I specifically ask.
- **When planning group activities:** Find a venue, park, court, or restaurant — don't default to my space.
- **I'm happy to attend and participate**, just not to organize or host.
