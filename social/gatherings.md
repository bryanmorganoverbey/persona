# Gathering Preferences

Preferred social gathering sizes:

1. **Small groups (3–6 people)** — the sweet spot.
2. **One-on-one hangouts** — for deeper conversation.
3. **Medium groups (7–15 people)** — fine for activities like volleyball or game nights.

## Agent Guidelines

- **When planning social events or suggesting activities:** Keep groups small to medium. Don't suggest large parties, networking events, or crowds.
- **Activity-based gatherings are preferred** over just "hanging out" — volleyball, board games, cooking together, going somewhere.
- **I don't host** (see [hosting.md](./hosting.md)). Suggest venues, parks, restaurants, or someone else's place.
- **Primary group activity is volleyball** — see [fitness/activities.md](../fitness/activities.md).
