# Regions of Interest

When suggesting destinations, prioritize these regions:

1. **Central America / Caribbean** — current region, familiar, affordable, warm.
2. **South America** — high interest for future exploration.
3. **Europe** — interested but as an extended trip, not quick visits.

## Agent Guidelines

- Don't suggest destinations outside these regions unless I ask to expand the search.
- Within these regions, apply the criteria from [destinations.md](./destinations.md) — warm, walkable, nomad-friendly.
- **Language advantage:** I speak Spanish, which covers most of these regions. See [languages/spoken.md](../languages/spoken.md).
