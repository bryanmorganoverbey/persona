# Trip Duration

Preferred stay length: **2–6 months**. I do slow, immersive travel — not quick trips.

## Agent Guidelines

- **Don't plan weekend getaways or 1-week vacations** unless I specifically ask. My default is multi-month stays.
- **When estimating costs**, calculate for 2–3 months minimum, not a week.
- **Visa considerations matter** — always check how long I can legally stay in a country on a tourist or digital nomad visa before suggesting it.
- **Flights:** One-way is fine. I don't always know when I'm leaving.
