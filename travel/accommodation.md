# Accommodation Preferences

When booking or recommending accommodation, use this priority order:

1. **Co-living spaces** — community-oriented, often includes coworking. Ideal for longer stays. Try this first for stays over 2 weeks.
2. **Airbnb / vacation rentals** — private space with a kitchen. Good fallback for any length of stay.
3. **Camping / glamping** — only for nature-focused trips, not as a default.

## Agent Guidelines

- **Never book a hotel** unless nothing else is available. I prefer spaces with kitchens and community.
- **For stays 2+ weeks:** Always look for co-living first. Check for coworking included.
- **For shorter stays:** Airbnb with a kitchen is the default.
- **Must-haves in any accommodation:** Reliable WiFi (100+ Mbps), a kitchen or kitchenette, and a workspace or desk.
- **Avoid:** Resorts, all-inclusive packages, hostels with shared dorms.
- **Similar criteria apply to housing** — see [housing/minimum-requirements.md](../housing/minimum-requirements.md) for permanent living standards.
- **Pet-friendly is required** — Remi travels with me. See [pets/current.md](../pets/current.md).
