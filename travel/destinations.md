# Destination Preferences

When suggesting travel destinations, prioritize places that match these criteria:

1. **Warm climate** — I gravitate toward beach / tropical locations with ocean access.
2. **Walkable** — I prefer cities where I can walk to daily needs without a car.
3. **Digital nomad friendly** — good internet, coworking options, community of remote workers, affordable cost of living.
4. **Mountains / hiking nearby** — nature access, trails, elevation, and fresh air are a strong bonus.

## Agent Guidelines

- **Default to warm destinations.** Don't suggest cold-weather cities unless I specifically ask.
- **Walkability is a requirement**, not a nice-to-have. If I need a car to get groceries, it's not a fit.
- **Check internet infrastructure** before recommending somewhere — remote work is non-negotiable, so reliable fast internet must exist.
- **Prioritize places with existing nomad communities** — I value regular group activities and social connection (see [values/core.md](../values/core.md)).
- See [regions.md](./regions.md) for geographic areas of interest.
