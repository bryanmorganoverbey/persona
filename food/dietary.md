# Dietary

No dietary restrictions. Open to all types of food.

## Agent Guidelines

- Never filter out options based on assumed restrictions — I have none.
- Don't default to "healthy" alternatives unless I specifically ask. I eat what I enjoy.
- If a recipe or restaurant menu includes something unusual or adventurous, include it — I'm open.
