# Favorite Cuisines

When recommending restaurants, recipes, or meal ideas, prefer these cuisines in rough order of frequency:

1. Korean
2. Japanese
3. Thai
4. Mexican
5. Indian
6. Italian
7. Mediterranean
8. American / Southern

## Agent Guidelines

- **Recommending a restaurant:** Default to the top 4 (Korean, Japanese, Thai, Mexican) unless I've had one of those recently.
- **Suggesting a new recipe:** Pull from any cuisine on the list. Avoid cuisines not listed unless I ask to try something new.
- **Meal planning for the week:** Mix it up — don't repeat the same cuisine two days in a row.
- **No dietary restrictions** — I eat everything. See [dietary.md](./dietary.md).
