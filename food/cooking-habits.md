# Cooking Habits

I cook at home most days — 5 or more per week. Eating out or ordering delivery is occasional, not the default.

## Agent Guidelines

- **Meal planning:** Assume I'm cooking. Don't suggest takeout or delivery unless I ask.
- **Recipe complexity:** I cook regularly, so intermediate-level recipes are fine. Don't oversimplify.
- **Grocery runs:** I shop for a full week of home cooking. See [basic-grocery-list.md](./basic-grocery-list.md) for staples.
- **When suggesting dinner:** Default to something I can cook, not a restaurant recommendation.
