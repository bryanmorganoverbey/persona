👨‍🍳 Instructions
	1.	Brown Meats
	•	In a large Dutch oven, heat 1 tbsp oil over medium-high.
	•	Season chicken with salt, pepper, and a little Cajun seasoning. Sear until browned but not fully cooked. Remove.
	•	Add sausage slices, cook until browned. Remove and set aside.
	2.	Cook Vegetables
	•	In remaining oil, sauté onion, bell peppers, celery, and jalapeño for ~5 minutes.
	•	Stir in garlic and okra. Cook another 3–5 minutes until okra softens and loses most of its “slime.”
	3.	Build the Base
	•	Stir in tomatoes, Cajun seasoning, thyme, and bay leaves.
	•	Return chicken and sausage to the pot.
	4.	Add Rice & Stock
	•	Stir in rice to coat with the spices.
	•	Pour in the stock, bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low.
	•	Simmer for 20–25 minutes, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed.
	5.	Cook Shrimp Separately
	•	While the rice cooks, sauté shrimp in butter with a pinch of Cajun seasoning. Cook until pink and just firm, about 2–3 mins. Set aside.
	6.	Finish the Dish
	•	When rice is done, remove bay leaves and fluff gently.
	•	Fold in cooked shrimp. Adjust seasoning, add hot sauce to taste.
	7.	Garnish & Serve
	•	Top with chopped green onion and parsley.
	•	Serve with lemon wedges and hot sauce on the side.

✅ Notes:
	•	Okra Tip: If using frozen okra, thaw and pat dry before sautéing to avoid extra moisture.
	•	Rice Tip: Don’t stir the rice while it simmers—this helps prevent gumminess.
	•	Smoky Boost: Add a splash of liquid smoke or a charred pepper for an extra campfire-style depth.
