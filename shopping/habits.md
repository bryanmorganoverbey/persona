# Shopping Habits

Balanced mix of online and in-store shopping (roughly 50/50). I buy secondhand and thrift when possible.

## Agent Guidelines

- **When recommending products:** Include secondhand / thrift options alongside new. Don't default to only new items.
- **Price and quality come first**, sustainability is a bonus (see [sustainability/philosophy.md](../sustainability/philosophy.md)).
- **Online vs. in-store:** No strong preference — suggest whichever is more practical for the item.
- **Don't upsell.** Recommend what fits the need, not the premium version unless I ask.
- **For clothing:** Default to athleisure style (see [fashion/style.md](../fashion/style.md)).
