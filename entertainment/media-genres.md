# Media Genres

Preferred movie and TV genres, in order of preference:

1. Thriller / suspense
2. Documentary
3. Comedy
4. Action / adventure

## Agent Guidelines

- **When recommending something to watch:** Default to thriller or documentary. Comedy and action are good when I want something lighter.
- **Avoid:** Romance-focused, reality TV, horror, and melodrama unless I ask.
- **Documentaries:** I lean toward topics I'm already interested in — technology, philosophy, psychology, travel, food, music.
- **For movie night suggestions:** One strong pick is better than a list of 10.
