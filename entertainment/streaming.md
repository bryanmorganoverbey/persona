# Streaming Services

Active subscriptions:

- **Netflix** — primary for shows and movies
- **Amazon Prime Video** — secondary
- **YouTube / YouTube Premium** — daily use for learning, music, and entertainment
- **Spotify** — music streaming

## Agent Guidelines

- **When recommending content:** Check Netflix and YouTube first — those are where I spend the most time.
- **Don't suggest content on platforms I don't have** (HBO Max, Hulu, Disney+, Apple TV+) unless it's worth subscribing for.
- **YouTube is a learning tool too**, not just entertainment — recommend channels and videos for topics in [education/interests.md](../education/interests.md).
