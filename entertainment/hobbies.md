# Hobbies

Leisure activities outside of work:

- **Volleyball / sports** — daily after-work activity with friends. This is the primary hobby.
- **Cooking** — I cook most meals at home (see [food/cooking-habits.md](../food/cooking-habits.md)).
- **Playing instruments** — guitar, piano, drums (see [music/instruments.md](../music/instruments.md)).
- **Travel** — slow, immersive stays in new places (see [travel/](../travel/)).
- **DIY / building things** — hands-on projects, physical or digital.
- **Board games / tabletop games** — social gaming with friends.

## Agent Guidelines

- **When suggesting activities or plans:** Volleyball is already locked in daily. Suggest other hobbies for variety, not as replacements.
- **When recommending gifts or experiences for me:** Anything related to these hobbies is a strong choice.
- **When planning a day or weekend:** Don't overschedule — I value downtime between activities. Weekends are for rest.
