# Gift Preferences

## What to Give

When selecting a gift on my behalf, use this priority order:

1. **Experiences** — trips, dinners, event tickets, classes. Always the best option.
2. **Food / drink** — quality coffee, wine, specialty food items. Safe and appreciated.
3. **Handmade / personalized items** — something with thought behind it.
4. **Clothing / accessories** — only if you know the person's style well.

## What I Like to Receive

Same order as above. Experiences > consumables > personalized > material goods.

## Agent Guidelines

- **Default to experiences** when suggesting gift ideas for anyone.
- **Avoid generic gifts** like gift cards, candles, or mass-produced decor.
- **Budget:** Ask me for the specific occasion — there's no fixed range.
- **When in doubt**, suggest a nice dinner out or an activity to do together.
