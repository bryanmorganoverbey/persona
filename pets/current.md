# Current Pets

I have a dog named **Remi**.

- **Size:** Medium breed
- **Activity level:** Active — needs lots of exercise and outdoor time
- **Diet:** Standard dog food

## Agent Guidelines

- **Remi travels with me.** When evaluating housing, accommodation, or travel, always check pet policies and pet-friendliness.
- **When evaluating a neighborhood or city:** Dog parks, walkability, and outdoor access matter.
- **Housing must be pet-friendly** — this is a hard filter, not a nice-to-have (see [housing/deal-breakers.md](../housing/deal-breakers.md)).
