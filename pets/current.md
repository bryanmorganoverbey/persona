# Current Pets

I have a dog named **Remi**.

- **Size:** Medium breed
- **Activity level:** Active — needs lots of exercise and outdoor time
- **Diet:** Standard dog food

## Training (In Progress)

**Goal:** Remi sits quietly under the chair or table at cafes, restaurants, and events without barking or making noise.

**Method:**
1. Command: "get under" — Remi goes under the chair/table where we're sitting
2. Treat reinforcement at regular intervals to reward calm, quiet behavior
3. Gradually extend intervals between treats as behavior becomes reliable

**Status:** Going well. Data sets are being tracked to measure progress.

## Agent Guidelines

- **Remi travels with me.** When evaluating housing, accommodation, or travel, always check pet policies and pet-friendliness.
- **When evaluating a neighborhood or city:** Dog parks, walkability, and outdoor access matter.
- **Housing must be pet-friendly** — this is a hard filter, not a nice-to-have (see [housing/deal-breakers.md](../housing/deal-breakers.md)).
- **When suggesting cafes or restaurants:** Check if they're dog-friendly. Remi is being trained to sit quietly under the table.
