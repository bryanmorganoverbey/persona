# Daily Drinks

Go-to daily beverages:

- **Latte / cappuccino** — morning non-negotiable. Coffee comes first every day.
- **Water** — throughout the day.
- **Coke Zero** — casual / afternoon.

## Agent Guidelines

- **Morning coffee is a requirement**, not a suggestion. See [daily-routine/morning.md](../daily-routine/morning.md).
- **When ordering for me:** Default to a latte. Cappuccino is a good alternative.
- **Don't suggest:** Tea, juice cleanses, smoothie replacements for coffee, or energy drinks.
