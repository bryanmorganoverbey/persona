# October 2026 Vision Board

Season: [Fall](../fall/index.md) | Tennessee

## Focus

Settling in. The house is set up — now it's about building the local life. Finding rhythm in the new environment.

## Goals

- Establish a consistent local routine (work, fitness, social)
- Set up a workshop / build space for robotics projects
- Enjoy fall in Tennessee — hiking, changing leaves, cooler weather
- Host? Consider having friends or family over to see the new place
