# Remi Public Behavior Training

## Goal

Continue reinforcing Remi's ability to sit quietly under the chair/table at cafes, restaurants, and events without barking or making noise.

## Method

1. Command: "get under" — Remi goes under the chair/table
2. Treat reinforcement at regular intervals to reward calm, quiet behavior
3. Gradually extend intervals between treats as behavior becomes reliable

## Status

In progress — going well. Data sets are being tracked to measure progress. Building on February training sessions.

## March Targets

- [ ] Consistent calm behavior in familiar cafes
- [ ] Test in new / unfamiliar restaurant environments
- [ ] Extend treat intervals (reduce frequency while maintaining behavior)
- [ ] Track data on duration of calm behavior per session
