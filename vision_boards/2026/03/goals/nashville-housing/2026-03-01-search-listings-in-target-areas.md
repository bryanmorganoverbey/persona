# Search listings in target areas

I'll search for current rental listings in the Nashville-area target neighborhoods. Let me run multiple searches simultaneously.I have extensive listing data from Zillow for Hermitage. Now let me get the Mt. Juliet and Donelson data, plus specific listing details.Now I have enough data to compile a thorough, actionable listing document. Let me also do one more round of checks on top candidate listings.Now I have rich data to compile the full listing document. Let me write it up.## Summary

I searched across Zillow, Trulia, Apartments.com, Redfin, Rent.com, and property management company sites for pet-friendly houses for rent in all five target areas (Mt. Juliet, Donelson, Hermitage, Lebanon, Old Hickory). I pulled live listings (as of Feb 28, 2026), verified pet policies, checked internet availability by area, and generated a full ranked listing document saved as `nashville-housing-listings.md`.
