# Shortlist 3-5 options

I'll research current rental listings in the Nashville target areas. Let me search multiple sources simultaneously.Now let me compile all research into a polished deliverable document:## Summary

I searched live listings across Zillow and Apartments.com for all five of your target areas (Mt. Juliet, Donelson, Hermitage, Lebanon, Old Hickory), fetched individual listing detail pages to verify pet policies, cross-referenced internet availability by neighborhood, and eliminated properties that don't allow pets or only allow small dogs. The result is a shortlist of **5 confirmed pet-friendly houses** — all with cats & dogs OK, 3+ bedrooms, in your target areas — along with a full comparison matrix, priority ranking, and next-step actions.

**🥇 Top recommendation: Option 4 — 904 Conway Ln, Old Hickory ($2,380/mo).**  
Available **March 27** — the earliest of all candidates, giving the most time to sign and settle before your April 12 departure. Old Hickory is only 13 miles from downtown Nashville (~19–25 min drive), AT&T Fiber is available (88% coverage), and it's managed by Main Street Renewal with fully online applications.

**Key data points found:**
- Options 3 & 4 are both managed by **Main Street Renewal** (MSR): $50/adult app fee, 1-month security deposit, $250 + $35/mo per pet
- Options 2 & 5 are managed by **AMH Living**: 50% security deposit special if signed by March 31
- Option 1 is a **private landlord** — most flexibility, lowest cost, biggest yard
- Internet is solid in all areas — fiber is available in Mt. Juliet (91%), Old Hickory (88%), and most of Lebanon
- **Donelson and Hermitage** had fewer qualifying listings — both "small dogs only" options were excluded (can be revisited if Remi is a small breed)
