# Wellness Practices

Regular wellness and mental health practices:

- **Meditation** — mindfulness and mental clarity
- **Journaling** — reflection and processing
- **Strict sleep schedule** — see [sleep.md](./sleep.md)
- **Time in nature** — walking, hiking, being outdoors

## Agent Guidelines

- **These are maintenance, not aspirational.** I already do these — don't suggest them as new habits.
- **When recommending wellness apps or tools:** I already have practices in place. Only suggest something if it genuinely improves what I'm already doing.
- **When planning a day or trip:** Build in outdoor time. I need nature access, not just indoor activities.
- **Fitness is separate** — see [fitness/activities.md](../fitness/activities.md) for exercise preferences (volleyball, yoga).
- **Daily routine context** — see [daily-routine/](../daily-routine/) for how wellness fits into the day.
