# Sleep

- **Bedtime:** 11pm–midnight
- **Wake up:** 7–9am
- **Target duration:** ~8 hours
- **Wind-down routine:** No screens before bed. Reading or other calming activity.

## Agent Guidelines

- **Don't schedule anything after 10pm** — wind-down starts then.
- **Don't suggest early morning activities** (before 7am). I'm not a 5am person.
- **Sleep is protected time** — it's the only do-not-disturb window (see [communication/channels.md](../communication/channels.md)).
- **When recommending health or productivity habits:** Don't suggest reducing sleep. 8 hours is the target, not a luxury.
