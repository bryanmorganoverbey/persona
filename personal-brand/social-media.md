# Social Media

## Active Platforms

- **Instagram** — occasional sharing. Travel, life updates, interesting moments.
- **YouTube** — present as a creator (or aspiring). Interest in creating tech/AI content.

## Posting Style

Occasional. I share when something is worth sharing — travel, projects, life updates. I don't post for the sake of consistency or engagement metrics.

## DMs

I use social media DMs for real conversations (see [communication/channels.md](../communication/channels.md)). Instagram DMs are a legitimate communication channel, not just for memes.

## What I Don't Do

- Post daily or maintain a content schedule
- Optimize for likes, followers, or engagement
- Use LinkedIn actively
- Use Twitter/X actively

## Agent Guidelines

- **Don't suggest a content calendar or posting schedule.** I post when I have something to share.
- **Don't suggest LinkedIn strategies.** I'm not active there and don't plan to be.
- **When suggesting how to share something:** Instagram for personal/visual content, YouTube for longer-form tech content.
- **Tone on social media matches real life** — casual, conversational, authentic. No corporate voice.
