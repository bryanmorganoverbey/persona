# Personal Brand Goals

## Primary Goal

Build a reputation in the **tech / AI space**. I want to be known for building interesting things with AI — not through networking or self-promotion, but through the work itself.

## How I Want to Get There

- **Build in public** — share projects, tools, and experiments
- **Create content** — YouTube videos about AI, dev tools, robotics, and building things
- **Open source** — contribute to and publish projects on GitHub
- **Let the work speak** — reputation through output, not through posting motivational quotes

## What I'm Not Trying to Do

- Become an influencer
- Build a massive following
- Monetize content as a primary income source
- Do speaking circuits or conference talks (unless it happens naturally)

## Agent Guidelines

- **When suggesting how to grow presence:** Focus on creating things (videos, repos, blog posts about builds) — not on marketing tactics.
- **YouTube is the primary content platform.** If I'm going to create content, it goes there.
- **GitHub is the portfolio.** Public repos and contributions matter more than a personal website.
- **Don't suggest hiring a social media manager, brand consultant, or PR strategy.** This grows organically through building.
